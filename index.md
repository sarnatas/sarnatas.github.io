#### Single-cell RNASeq and Spatial Transcriptomics data analysis specialist


### Education
- Ph.D., Computational Biology | University of Strasbourg (France) (_2020_)								       		
- M.S., Physics	| University of Naples (Italy) (_2016_)	 			        		

### Coordinator of the Data Analysis working group @ [Spatial-Cell-ID](https://spatial-cell-id.ens-lyon.fr/), ENS of Lyon, France<br />
Spatial-Cell-ID is a national Spatial Transcriptomics facility that aims to study cellular identity and its spatial heterogeneity within tissues, organs, or biological systems in normal and pathological contexts, through very recent developments in spatial transcriptomics.

I lead the bioinformatics efforts at Spatial-Cell-ID by: <br />
• Implementing data analysis pipelines;<br />
• Developing new bioinformatics procedures and tools;<br />
• Communicating and presenting findings; <br />
• Coordinating skill transfers between labs; <br />
• Providing training to the users;<br />
• Supervising young researchers.<br />
