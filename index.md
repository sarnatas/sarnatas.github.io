## About Me
I hold a PhD in Computational Biology and a Master's degree in Physics, complemented by years of practical experience in Bioinformatics. 

Currently, I am the coordinator of the data analysis working group at Spatial-Cell-ID (ENS of Lyon). My professional journey is centered around the analysis of diverse biological datasets, including bulk RNA-Seq, single-cell RNA-Seq, Spatial Transcriptomics, and Hi-C.

Proficient in Python, R, shell scripting (bash), and High-Performance Computing (HPC), I navigate the intricacies of large-scale data with ease. My grounding in mathematics, predictive modeling, and statistics adds depth to my analytical capabilities.

My expertise extends to the development and application of various bioinformatics tools. I've contributed as both a first and corresponding author to scientific publications.

In addition, I bring extensive experience in teaching university students.
